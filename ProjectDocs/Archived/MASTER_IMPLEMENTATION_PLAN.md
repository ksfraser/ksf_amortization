## Implementation Strategy

**Fast-track approach:**
1. Core functionality first (no optional features)
2. Comprehensive testing for each component
3. Integration tests between phases
4. Documentation as code
5. Git commits after each major feature

**Quality gates:**
- 100% test pass rate maintained
- Zero regressions
- Performance improvement validated
- Security review passed

## Estimated Timeline

- Phase 17: 2-3 hours
- Phase 18: 2-3 hours
- Phase 19: 3-4 hours
- Phase 20: 2-3 hours
- **Total: 9-13 hours for full completion**

## Implementation Order

1. **Cache Layer** ✅ DONE
2. **Query Optimization** - Next
3. **Security/RBAC**
4. **REST API**
5. **Advanced Features**
6. **Master Report**
